Abstract
This paper analyzes publicly available data about stock trades and transactions made by members of the House of Representatives within the United States of Americaâ€™s Legislative Branch. This analysis focuses on the networks and community structures formed by these politicians and the specific company stocks or industries of stocks that they focus their transactions on. The study seeks to determine relationships that exist in terms of similarities and differences in the financial behaviors of these politicians based on characteristics such as party affiliation, and the activities of these politicians as it pertains to given market sectors. Measures of centrality, community detection, and degree distribution analysis are a few of the network analysis tools utilized in this project.
